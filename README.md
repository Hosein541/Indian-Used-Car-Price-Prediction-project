## Project Overview
The aim of this data science project is to predict the price of used cars in major Indian metro cities. The prediction is based on various car features, including the car's manufacturer, model, variant, fuel type, color, kilometers driven, body style, transmission type, manufacture date, model year, CNG kit availability, ownership history, dealer details, and a quality score. The project utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide insights and price predictions, ultimately helping both buyers and sellers in the used car market.

### Summary and Conclusion

In this project, I focused on predicting the prices of used cars in India using various data preprocessing techniques and a machine learning model. The steps and methodologies employed are as follows:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - String to Numeric Conversion: Converted values in the price column from strings to numeric format.
   - Handling Missing Values: Removed columns with a high number of null values to ensure data quality and consistency.
   - Categorical Simplification: Reduced the number of unique values in some categorical columns to simplify the model.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Created appropriate visualizations to explore and understand the data patterns and relationships, providing valuable insights into the dataset.

3. Data Standardization and Label Encoding:
   - Performed data standardization to normalize the features.
   - Applied label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.

4. Model Training and Optimization:
   - Trained a Random Forest model on the processed dataset.
   - Optimized the model using Grid Search to improve accuracy.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - The final model achieved an accuracy of 74.8%. Given the complexity of the model and the variability of the data, this result is considered satisfactory.

These steps ensured a comprehensive analysis and model training process, leading to a reasonably accurate prediction model for used car prices in Indi
